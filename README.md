# CleanCode
My presentation about Clean Code for SE.

The BadEmployee class shows a class which isn't formatted and is no example of Clean Code.
There are useless comments, no empty lines for grouping, a lot of inline code which makes the class very dirty.

The GoodEmployee class is a class which uses the Priciples of Clean Code.
It uses the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by being a data class.
It has good formatting and is readable.

I used a tool called codify, which detects code smnells in your project by adding your repository to it.
An example can be shown by clicking on the CodifyExample.png.
